🌍 WeatherFractal: Visualizing Weather Data Through Code 🌍

I’m excited to share a Python project that transforms real-time weather data into mesmerizing fractal art. This program fetches live weather details for cities worldwide and uses them to generate colorful, dynamic Julia Set fractals. Each fractal reflects the unique weather conditions of a city—temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover—resulting in a constantly evolving visual experience.

The fractals transition smoothly between cities, creating a hypnotic blend of art, data, and code. Imagine this as a stunning digital installation for weather-based storytelling or ambient displays in public spaces!


💻 Key Features:
Libraries Used: Pygame, NumPy, Requests, Colorsys
API Integration: Real-time data integration with OpenWeatherMap API.
Dynamic Visuals: Weather data drives fractal zoom, iterations, and colors.
Creative Transitioning: Cities cycle seamlessly with evolving fractal designs.

✅Applications:
Public art installations visualizing global weather patterns.
Ambient digital displays for science museums or exhibitions.
An inspiring blend of data and art for educational or personal projects.
